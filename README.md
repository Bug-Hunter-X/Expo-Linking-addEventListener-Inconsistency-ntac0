# Expo Linking.addEventListener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a bug related to the inconsistency of the `Linking.addEventListener` function in Expo's Linking API. The issue manifests as the event listener not always firing when a deep link is opened, resulting in unpredictable application behavior.

## Problem

The `Linking.addEventListener` is crucial for handling deep links, allowing your app to respond to external URLs. However, this listener sometimes fails to trigger, causing deep links to be ignored. This inconsistency impacts app functionality and user experience.

## Solution

The proposed solution involves implementing more robust error handling and potentially using alternative approaches, such as checking for initial URLs on app launch to ensure that no deep links are missed.
